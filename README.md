# My Dotfiles
I'm not expecting anyone to look at my dotfiles and be like "Wow lemme use this" but if for some reason someone is bored enough to do it, *hell, I don't even use Linux anymore because it's constant need to be problematic like a clingy ex girlfriend keeps being a thorn in my a-"* ANYWAYS
## My setup 
- Distro: Something Arch based
- DE: Plasma
- WM: KWIn 
## Required Packages
- pfetch (for .bashrc that is)

If you have Arch linux, install it from the AUR as so:
```
yay -S pfetch
```
For all other distros, refer this to this [video][pfetch] or figure out a easier way to install it on there distros have me update this section
