# My Dotfiles
I'm not expecting anyone to look at my dotfiles and be like "Wow lemme use this" but if for some reason someone is bored enough to do it, here's the rundown 
## My setup 
- Distro: Manjaro
- DE: Plasma
- WM: KWIn
## Required Packages
- pfetch
If you have Arch linux, install it from the AUR as so:
```yay 
-S pfetch
```
For all other distros, refer this to this [video][pfetch] or figure out a easier way to install it on there distros have me update this section
